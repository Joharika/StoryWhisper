Story Whisper is a Telegram bot designed to ease the nighttime routine for busy parents by transforming bedtime stories into magical audio experiences for children. The inspiration for this project came from the need to support hardworking parents who, after a long and chaotic day, might find it challenging to tell bedtime stories to their children. Story Whisper provides a simple solution: parents can send an image of a story, and the bot will read it aloud, creating a voice message that can be played anytime.
